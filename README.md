- 🌠  Hello there! I'm Hiroji and I'm a gen z furry and human pony / pup living in Scotland (yay), United Kingdom (regrettably).
- ⚛️  I'm a software developer by trade so I created this account to host all my fun personal projects that I don't want work to see ^w^ . Expect dodgy furry stuff and OP Xenoblade databases and React with a sprinkling of TypeScript.
- 🏳️‍🌈  If you've not yet noticed I am quite incredibly queer. I'm a MLM gay man with fucking LOTR elf hair whose quite active in the bdsm community.
- 🏳️‍⚧️ Trans Rights now!
